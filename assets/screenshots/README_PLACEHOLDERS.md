Screenshots & GIF placeholders

Place screenshots or short GIFs demonstrating the app flow in this directory and then reference them from the project README.

Recommendations:
- Filenames: `home.png`, `order_flow.gif`, `options.png`.
- Sizes: Phone portrait - 1080x1920; Phone landscape - 1280x720. Use 60-200 KB PNGs where possible for printable README previews.
- GIFs: keep to 2-6 seconds and loop. Keep file size < 5MB for repo convenience.

How to add to README.md:
1. Add the image file to this folder.
2. Edit `README.md` and add Markdown like:

   ![Home screen](assets/screenshots/home.png)

That's it!
